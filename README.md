## Introduction

This is still the apocalypse due to COVID-19 and I am still stuck at home. This means more depression and anxiety but it also means more time to explore.

This repo will contain exercises and code written while reading through 2 haskell books.
1. Haskell Programming from First Principles by Chris Allen and Julie Morounuki
2. Learn You a Haskell by Miran Lipovaca

Each will be in separate files and will try to be as simple and explicit as possible.

## Motivation

During my compilers class @ school, we decided to follow http://www.stephendiehl.com/llvm/#external-functions and to create a JIT Compiled Lannguage with Haskell and LLVM and eventually extend it. 
Given that my team was competent enough we decided to take this journey in not only learning about compilers but to learn and use Haskell along the way.
